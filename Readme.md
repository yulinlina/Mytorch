Scorecard-Bundle is a high-level Scorecard modeling API that is easy-to-use and Scikit-Learn consistent. It covers the major steps to train a Scorecard model such as feature discretization with ChiMerge, WOE encoding, feature evaluation with information value and collinearity, Logistic-Regression-based Scorecard model, and model evaluation for binary classification tasks. All the transformer and model classes in Scorecard-Bundle comply with Scikit-Learn‘s fit-transform-predict convention.
